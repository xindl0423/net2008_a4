The Python is meant to simulate rolling a 6 sided dice.
When running the app, it was ask the user to hit "Enter" to roll the dice.
Then program will generate a random number between 1 and 6 and display the result.
You can choose to roll the dice again by entering 'yes' or 'y'.
If the user wants to exit the program, they can hit any key to exit because it only checks for
'yes' and 'y'.
